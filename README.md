# twitter-retweet-bot
 A simple bot (automation) used to retweet/unretweet NFT giveaway tweets from Twitter

# How to use
 1. Open variables.py and fill up the necessary information (DRIVER, USER_DATA, PROFILE, TEXT, USER) according to what you want to require
 2. The executables are retweet.bat(to retweet) and unretweet.bat(to unretweet)
 3. Simply launch either of the .bat file by double clicking it, and copy-paste the link to the tweet (CTRL+C on browser, right click to paste when you open the terminal/command prompt) 


# Notes
 1. We're using Microsoft Edge as the browser to run the twitter bot. Hence, if you're using MS Edge as your primary browser, it will likely not work. A solution would either be change your primary browser to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc. (easier) or change the code to launch in the 2 browser mentioned prevously (harder)
 2. This bot is still in its early stage and has some limitations, so do feel free to give feedback on bugs or what can be improved!
 3. When running this program, Microsoft Edge cannot be running in the background because it will cause an error like (msedge.exe is no longer running, so msedgedriver is assuming that msedge has crashed.). To resolve this issue, open "Task Manager", find the Microsoft Edge program that's running in the background processes and end it
 4. There are some edge cases that will cause this automation to not work (For example, if your comments are way down in the comment section). I will be working on it to possibly find a solution!
 5. This automation is optimized for desktop use!
